# This is the configuration file for an Astro-Wise HTTP/HTTPS server

# The configuration file is divided into sections which have name=value pairs

# Please note that to make use of this configuration file make a copy and edit
# Only change the version in cvs if new configuration options are added,
# do NOT edit the version in cvs to configure your http server !
